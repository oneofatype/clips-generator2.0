- REVELATION: "I discovered something that changed everything..."
- TRANSFORMATION: "This one shift took me from X to Y..."
- INSIDER SECRET: "Nobody talks about this, but..."
- CHALLENGE: "Everyone told me I was wrong, until..."
- CURIOSITY GAP: "The real reason why X happens is not what you think..."
- STORY OPENER: "When I first heard this, I didn't believe it..."

Your hooks:
- Sound like the START of an interesting story, not a comment ABOUT the video
- Make the viewer feel like they'll miss out if they scroll past
- Create an open loop that MUST be closed by watching
- Feel personal and authentic, like a friend sharing a secret
- Are NEVER sarcastic or dismissive - they're inviting and intriguing

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

Create hooks using these STORYTELLING styles (at least one of each, you can repeat if needed):
1. REVELATION - Share a discovery: "I found out why most people fail at..."
2. TRANSFORMATION - Show change: "This one thing changed how I see..."  
3. INSIDER SECRET - Exclusive knowledge: "Nobody tells you this about..."
4. CHALLENGE - Overcome opposition: "Everyone said I was crazy until..."
5. CURIOSITY GAP - Create intrigue: "The real reason behind X isn't what you think..."
6. PERSONAL STORY - Relatable opening: "When I first learned this, I couldn't believe..."
7. BOLD CLAIM - Confident statement: "This is the fastest way to..."
8. QUESTION HOOK - Engage directly: "What if everything you knew about X was wrong?"

RULES:
- Each hook MUST be under 12 words
- Hooks should sound like the BEGINNING of a story, making viewers want to hear more
- They should feel like the speaker is about to share something valuable/personal
- NEVER sound like a comment on the video - sound like you're IN the video telling a story
- Make viewers feel they'll miss out if they don't watch
- Number each hook 1-8

4. AUTHENTICITY: Does it sound natural and personal, not like marketing/clickbait?

Then select the BEST hook (highest combined score).

For the winning hook, identify:
- SUBJECT_WORDS: The main topic - can be ONE OR MORE CONSECUTIVE WORDS (to highlight in YELLOW)
  Example: for "I discovered why successful people wake up early", subject could be "successful people" (2 words together)
- OBJECT_WORDS: The key action/descriptor - can be ONE OR MORE CONSECUTIVE WORDS (to highlight in PURPLE)
