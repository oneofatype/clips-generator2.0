  "reasoning": "This hook achieves the highest score (35) by maximizing Negativity Bias and Cognitive Dissonance. The concept of firing 'qualified' people (usually a positive trait) creates immediate shock and curiosity. It triggers deep professional insecurity (fear) and invites debate about meritocracy, while remaining defensible as a 'culture fit' narrative."
