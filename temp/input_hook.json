  "reasoning": "This hook scores highest because it attacks a 'sacred cow' (experts/gurus). It triggers 'Imposter Syndrome' anxieties while simultaneously validating the audience's skepticism of online authority. It poses a question rather than a statement, which psychologically compels users to answer in the comments to either defend their expertise or vent their frustrations, maximizing engagement metrics."
